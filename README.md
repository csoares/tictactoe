# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple tic tac toe game built with React. It is a part of the [React Lectures](https://reactjs.org) at my web programming lectures.

## How to play

The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Each player takes a turn and places their mark on an empty square. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

## How to run

To run the game, clone the repo and run `npm start` in the project directory.
